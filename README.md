`four-ai` is a neural network training system that utilizes [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm). Everything related to neural networks was implemented from scratch, including matrix multiplication, neural network forward pass, and crossover + mutation.

This is a proof of concept for how a genetic algorithm library could be implemented with rust in the future.
